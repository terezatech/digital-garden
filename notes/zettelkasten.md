Zettelkasten is a method of note taking that is based on the idea of creating small notes that are linked together. The notes are called zettels and are linked together using a unique identifier. The idea is that you can create a large number of small notes that are linked together and can be used to create a large body of knowledge. The notes can be linked together in a variety of ways and can be used to create a large body of knowledge.
